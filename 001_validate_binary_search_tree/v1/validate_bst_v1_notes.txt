This first stab at it is woefully verbose compared to the LeetCode answer.

Notes from the LeetCode answer:

-Their logic is so much simpler! My error was trying to process the node's children at all instead of restricting my answer to the node itself.

Next step: attempt to blindly recreate the LeetCode answer.

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right


class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
