This (quite easy) problem was used as an example in LeetCode's Recursion II course, so I learned about it that way before tackling it here. I'll quickly write up a pair of solutions, compare their runtimes, and move on.

This is a recursive solution. v2 will be iterative.

Provided sample code:

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
