An iterative version of the basic, recursive solution to the problem.

Surprisingly, the recursive version is faster! (See performance_test.py.) This probably is because of all the valid() function calls involved in the iterative version. I'll copy v2 and transplant the valid() function's contents into the main loop and see if that speeds things up.
