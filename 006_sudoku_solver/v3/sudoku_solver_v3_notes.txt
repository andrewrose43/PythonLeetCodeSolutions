This solution ran much slower than v2, which makes sense in hindsight - instead of simply checking membership of a set, v3 uses a mess of zip() calls and list comprehensions to validate each and every attempt to place a digit. So, as clever as this solution is, v2's set-based implementation remains best.

I had thought v3 would be the last version, but I realized that the cached lists at the start of solveSudoku() should be made tuples, so v4 makes that slight improvement.
