This question just asks you to write a sorting algorithm. I implemented merge
sort. See https://github.com/andrewrose43/PythonDSA/tree/main/1_merge_sort for
my 11-part quest for the perfect Python implementation of merge sort, in which
I wrote 11 variants of merge sort and tested their performance.
