My blind attempt to recreate the LeetCode example produced essentially the LeetCode example, but paraphrased a bit differently. My blind attempt inverted the boolean logic checking whether the node's value is acceptable, which changes nothing in practical terms.

Actually, my boolean logic is slightly syntactically cleaner than the LeetCode example's boolean logic, so I consider it an improvement.
