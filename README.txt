This repo contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, all written in Python.

For each problem, "v1" is my first correct answer to the problem. It's unlikely to be optimal.

For each subsequent version, I read the official LeetCode solution and/or others' solutions, make a couple quick notes about whatever those solutions did better than mine, try to recreate those solutions, writing a better and better solution each time.

For this reason, and because well-optimized solutions tend to converge toward the same code, the final, optimized version will often be a near-exact copy of the official LeetCode solution. To verify that I actually am writing and learning all this and not just mindlessly copying LeetCode's answers, look at the earlier versions and their accompanying notes to watch as my work gradually progresses toward perfection.
