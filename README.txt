This repo contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, all written in Python.

For each problem, "v1" is my first correct answer to the problem. It's unlikely to be optimal.

For each subsequent version, I look up others' solutions, make a couple quick notes about whatever those solutions did better than mine, then close them and try to recreate them blind, writing a better and better solution each time.
